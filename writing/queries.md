2. What is the command that shows the attributes of the tables of your database?

    + Enter your query:

    TODO

    + What was one line of this result?

    TODO

3. How many protID entities are contained in each of the tables in your database? Hint: use the `count(...)` function in your query.

    + Enter your query:

    TODO

    + What was one line of this result?

    TODO

4. How many unique organisms are in each table of your database? Hint: use `count(distinct(...))` in your query.
